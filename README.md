A Streamlit dashboard for predicting child malnutrition risk using food prices and GDP per capita"
Malnutrition Predictor Dashboard
This project is a Streamlit-based web dashboard that helps visualize and analyze the relationship between child malnutrition (stunting) and key indicators like food price index and GDP per capita across different countries.

It supports SDG Goal 2: Zero Hunger, by enabling policymakers, NGOs, and researchers to:

Explore historical stunting trends by country
Compare global malnutrition rates
Predict risk of high malnutrition using machine learning models

Features
Visual EDA: Trends by year, region, and economic indicators

Predictive Modeling: Classify malnutrition risk using Logistic Regression and other ML models

Interactive Dashboard (built with Streamlit)
Clean dataset merged from UNICEF, FAOSTAT, and World Bank sources
Files
malnutrition_dashboard.py – Streamlit app code

final_data.csv – Cleaned and merged dataset

Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Streamlit (for building the dashboard)

GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
